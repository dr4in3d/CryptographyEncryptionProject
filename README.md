# CryptographyEncryptionProject

The goal of this project was to emulate the PKI asymmetrical encryption process including cracking it. In this project there are two encryption algorithms: El Gamal and RSA. When running the program you'll be prompted with a menu where you select the encryption algorithm. After that you will be able to choose 1 of 4 options: Generate Key, Encrypt Message, Decrypt Message, and Intercept Message.
